A library to create a terminal user interface

Run
$ make git
To fetch submodule @ https://github.com/erratic-c-programmer/libmds

Then
$ make
To compile; requires gcc. This builds:
Libraries libascii.so, libascii.a
And
Binaries maze and test

It's _very_ lacking in features, and the 'object system' actually just
means 'sprite system'; I only call it that because I may want to extend it later on.
